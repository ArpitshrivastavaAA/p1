    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,composition,and behavior of matter.
        it is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its 
        chemical symbol,such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen ,and O for oxygen.Elements are classified into 
        groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <dfn>chemical equations.</dfn>Here's an example of a 
    <dfn>chemical reaction:</dfn></p>
    <p><sub>2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O</sub></p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(H2) and oxygen gas(O2) to form water(H2O).</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.It involves balancing
        chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p><sub>subscript</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule ,while <sup>superscripts</sup>
    represent charges of the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h5>conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us.form the composition of the air we breathe 
       to the reactions that power our bodies,chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
